        <p>For this visualization we use matplotlib to quickly create a scatter plot based on the data given. Where each point is 
          plotted first by the Lattitude and then by the wind speeds at the time the data was pulled from the API.

        <p>It seems that no city had no wind at all when the data was recorded. While a few cities saw 30+ mph wind the majority was 
          under 10mph. All the cities over 30mph winds were either close to the equator or in the southern hemisphere. Perhaps the data 
          was taken during a period of tropical storms?
